abstract="This study represents an efficient method for extracting product aspects from customer reviews and give solutions for inferring aspect ratings and aspect weights. Aspect ratings often reflect the user's satisfaction on aspects of a product and aspect weights reflect the degree of importance of the aspects posed by the user. These tasks therefore play a very important role for manufacturers to better understand their customers' opinion on their products and services. The study addresses the problem of aspect extraction by using aspect words based on conditional probability combined with the bootstrap technique. To infer the user's rating for aspects, a supervised approach called the Na{\"i}ve Bayes classification method is proposed to learn the aspect ratings in which sentiment words are considered as features. The weight of an aspect is estimated by leveraging the frequencies of aspect words within each review and the aspect consistency across all reviews. Experimental results show that the proposed method obtains very good performance on real world datasets in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.",

abstract="More people are buying products online and expressing their opinions on these products through online reviews. Sentiment analysis can be used to extract valuable information from reviews, and the results can benefit both consumers and manufacturers. This research shows a study which compares two well known machine learning algorithms namely, dynamic language model and na{\"i}ve Bayes classifier. Experiments have been carried out to determine the consistency of results when the datasets are of different sizes and also the effect of a balanced or unbalanced dataset. The experimental results indicate that both the algorithms over a realistic unbalanced dataset can achieve better results than the balanced datasets commonly used in research.",
